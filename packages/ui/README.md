The eventual goal for this UI is to allow uploading and loading stored mazes at
at the top-level. Choosing a maze from the selector will load the maze UI with
the selected maze and will provide a dropdown for choosing an algorithm and a
button to solve the maze.

Solving the maze will animate the solution in the grid.
